# Carbon.IncludeAssetsCache Package for Neos CMS

Extend [Carbon.IncludeAssets] with an seperate cache entry for the included files.
If a file changes, the cache gets flushed. This is useful if you have got dynamic CSS or JavaScript files on your server.

## Installation

Most of the time, you have to make small adjustments to a package (e.g., the configuration in [`Settings.yaml`]). Because of that, it is important to add the corresponding package to the composer from your theme package. Mostly this is the site package located under `Packages/Sites/`. To install it correctly go to your theme package (e.g.`Packages/Sites/Foo.Bar`) and run following command:

```bash
composer require carbon/includeassetscache --no-update
```

The `--no-update` command prevent the automatic update of the dependencies. After the package was added to your theme `composer.json`, go back to the root of the Neos installation and run `composer update`. Et voil√†! Your desired package is now installed correctly.
